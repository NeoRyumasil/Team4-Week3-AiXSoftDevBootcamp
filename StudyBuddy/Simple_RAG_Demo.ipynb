    "Here's what happened behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **📄 Document Processing**\n",
    "- Your documents were broken into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Each chunk contains about 1000 characters with 200 character overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **🧮 Creating Embeddings**  \n",
    "- Each text chunk was converted into a 384-dimensional vector\n",
    "- Similar texts have similar vectors (closer in \"space\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **🗃️ Vector Storage**\n",
    "- All vectors were stored in ChromaDB database\n",
    "- This allows fast similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **🔍 Question Processing**\n",
    "- Your question was also converted to a vector\n",
    "- System found the most similar document chunks\n",
    "- Top 5 most relevant chunks were selected\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **🤖 Answer Generation**\n",
    "- Relevant chunks were sent to Gemini AI\n",
    "- AI generated an answer based on the context\n",
    "- Sources were tracked and returned\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add more documents to `data/documents/` folder\n",
    "- Try the web interface: `python run.py`\n",
    "- Experiment with settings in `config/settings.py`\n",
    "- Check out the full demo: `RAG_Pipeline_Demo.ipynb`"
